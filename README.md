## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to identify patterns in Citibike use in New York City based on gender and service user type (subscriber or new customer). A data story was created with supporting visuals using Tableau.

 The data story can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/carl.tusz/viz/NYCCitibikeAnalysis_16460155804540/CitibikeinNewYorkCity?publish=yes). The following results will be referencing images at the above link.

## Results

Results described by each slide in the Tableau story are summarized below.

### Slide One: Usership by Gender

This pie chart shows the relative usership for people identifying as male or female, and for riders whose gender was unknown. About a quarter of the riders are female, the gender is unknown for around one eighth of the riders, and the remainder of use is by males.

### Slide Two: Distribution of Trip Duration

This image shows the distribution of trip durations for trips under 3 hours in length. There is a clear peak for trips around 10 minutes in length. Relative to this peak, very few trips exceed 60 minutes in duration.

### Slide Three: Dristribution of Trip Duration by Gender

The distribution trend didn't change much when split into gendered categories. Male and female riders both tended to take trips around 10 minutes in length, and primarily under 30 minutes in duration. Users with unknown genders showed a plateau of use with trips between 10 and 25 minutes.

### Slide Four: Weekday and Time Heatmap

This heatmap shows that the peak riding times are different during the work week versus the weekend. During the week, ridership peaks between 7 and 9 AM, and between 5 and 7 PM (commuting hours). On weekends there is a more steady use of the bikes throughout the day during daylight hours, peaking just before noon.

### Slide 5: Customer Type, Weekday, and Gender Heatmap

The day of the week had a large impact on when different types of users tended to use the bike service. Subscribers were most likely to use the bikes during the week, while customers were more likely to ride on weekends. The gender was unknown primarly for customers rather than subscribers.

### Slide 6: Gender, Ride Weekday and Time Heatmap

This heatmap shows the volume of riders for each gender by the time of day the trip takes place. Male and female riders both tended to ride most during commuting hours of weekdays, on Saturday mornings, and Sunday afternoons. Riders with unknown genders mirrored these trends for the weekends, but had very few rides recorded during weekdays.

### Slide 7: Trip Starting Locations

This bubble-map shows which stations bike trips are most frequently started from. Rides were most commonly started in the southern end of the city, near areas such as Central Park and Times Square. This pattern is expected as there is the highest population density in these areas.

### Slide 8: Trip Ending Locations

This bubble-map shows which stations bike trips are most frequently started from. Rides were most commonly started in the southern end of the city, near areas such as Central Park and Times Square. This pattern is expected as there is the highest population density in these areas, and commuters would be ending their rides in the city center.

## Summary

In general, this analysis found that subscription male commuters dominated the usership of the bike service, with short (under 25 minute) rides during commuting hours on weekdays. Female users followed similar trends to the male users, with the exception of lower overall ridership. Riders with unknown genders tended to be observed primarily on weekends.
